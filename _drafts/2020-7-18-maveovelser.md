The roll-out and pike were the most effective exercises in activating the core muscles compared to all exercises. Lumbar paraspinal activity was relatively low for all exercises.

Pike, roll-out, Knee-up, and skier exercises The relatively high core muscle activity during the pike, roll-out, knee-up, and skier exercises, compared to the crunch and bent-knee sit-up exercises, suggests that these exercises are good alternatives to traditional abdominal exercises for core muscle recruitment. Moreover, these exercises may be beneficial for individuals with limited workout

From the perceived exertion ratings scale,3 the mean (SD) perceived exertion of 14.6 (2.1) for the pike is classified as hard, which was the highest rating for all exercises. In contrast, the mean (SD) perceived exertions of 12.6 (2.2), 12.7 (1.5), and 13.3 (1.5), respectively, for the roll-out, kneeup, and skier exercises are classified as somewhat hard.
